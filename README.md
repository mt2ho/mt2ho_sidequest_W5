## Description

This is a blob platformer with dynamic camera movement. The camera's lerp has been reduced and now looks further ahead, to create an immersive feeling. The player navigates through platforms and obstacles, and when they drop down, the colour changes to an underwater pallete and environment. The blob is floaty when falling. Along the way, players can interact with yellow orbs to change their color, and at the end, they can respawn after falling down.
